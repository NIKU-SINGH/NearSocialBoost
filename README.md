NearSocialBoost is a revolutionary crowdfunding application built on the Near blockchain that aims to fuel the success of projects building on the Near Protocol. By combining the power of blockchain technology with a social touch, NearSocialBoost empowers projects and amplifies connections within the Near Ecosystem.

## Overview

NearSocialBoost provides a decentralized platform for project creators to raise funds and gain recognition within the Near community. The application includes a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that plays a pivotal role in recognizing valuable projects and facilitating community engagement. Users can become members of the DAO by minting Membership NFTs and acquiring voting ERC-20 tokens. Proposals submitted to the DAO require a 10% voting favor to pass, ensuring a fair and transparent decision-making process.
